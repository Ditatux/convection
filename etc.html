        <p>This project is for my science class (but you probably already know this)<br>
        I started by making a folder called "Base" and creating a file called "index.html"<br>
        HTML stands for Hypertext markup language and is what id call the skeleton.<br>
        Then I made the other files and added things to them, Dont expect me to use WIX<br>
        or any other of those crappy free "website designers" that limit me a ton, I <br>
        shal only use HTML from my skills. Now after I finish this page I shall go<br>
        throught the process of registering a domain name.
        </p>
        <p>So basically you have the original copy of the html documents on<br>
           github where the domain name redirects you to because its expensive to host your own servers most<br>
           of the time and spongebob can fly a plane but cant drive a boat.

        <p>At this point I cant find any way but this, Aka to become meta and cover different subjects<br>
           Usually loaded parents will give their kids a Lamborghini or a Ferrari but most of the time they<br>
           Cannot appreciate the other cars on the road and usually will have little to no driving skills<br>
           While drag racing their car and probably getting it wrecked while some guy in an Eight six passes them</p>
