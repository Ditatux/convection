        <p>This project is for my science class (but you probably already know this)<br>
        I started by making a folder called "Base" and creating a file called "index.html"<br>
        HTML stands for Hypertext markup language and is what id call the skeleton.<br>
        Then I made the other files and added things to them, Dont expect me to use WIX<br>
        or any other of those crappy free "website designers" that limit me a ton, I <br>
        shal only use HTML from my skills. Now after I finish this page I shall go<br>
        throught the process of registering a domain name.
